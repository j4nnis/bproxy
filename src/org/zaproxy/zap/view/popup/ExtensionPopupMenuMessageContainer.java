     * {@code isEnableForMessageContainer(MessageContainer)}, with {@code invoker} as parameter, returns {@code true}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * All the child menus that implement {@code ExtensionPopupMenuComponent} will have the methods
     * {@code precedeWithSeparator()}, {@code succeedWithSeparator()}, {@code getMenuIndex()} and {@code isSafe()} honoured,
     * with the following caveats:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code precedeWithSeparator()} - the separator will only be added if there's already a menu component in the menu and
     * if it is not a separator;</li>
     * <li>{@code succeedWithSeparator()} - the separator will be added always but removed if there's no item following it when
     * the menu is ready to be shown;</li>
     * <li>{@code getMenuIndex()} - the menu index will be honoured only if the method {@code isOrderChildren()} returns
     * {@code true};</li>
     * </ul>
     * The separators will be dynamically added and removed as needed when the pop up menu is shown.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Implementation Note:</strong> The method {@code isEnableForMessageContainer(MessageContainer)} is called on all
     * child {@code ExtensionPopupMenuComponent}s, even if a previous child has returned {@code true}, as it allows to notify
     * all the children that the pop up menu in which they are, is being invoked. Subclasses should take it into account when
     * overriding this the method.
